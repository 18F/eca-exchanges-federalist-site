TechGirls is a U.S.-based summer exchange program designed to empower and support young women (ages 15-17) from the United States and select countries around the world to pursue higher education and careers in in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields through hands-on skills development training with American technologists. The centerpiece of the program is an approximately ten-day technology camp, hosted on a U.S. university campus, that provides participants with an in-depth examination of cutting-edge technologies and various educational and professional paths in STEM fields. The camp is complemented by additional activities such as site visits to technology companies, leadership workshops, job shadow experiences, community service opportunities, cultural/recreational events, and homestays with American families. As part of program follow-on, the TechGirls implement at least one peer training program or service project within their schools and/or communities.
